Microheater is an essential component in MEMS device including gas sensor. However it is difficult to measure the exact temperature inside the area bounded by microheater. Non-contact based thermometer such as typical Infrared Cemera can not work because of their low spatial resullation and contact based themal probe can destry the sensitive element in the microheater. Moreover, only simulation is also difficult to do because of unknown inilaial initial condition (temperature on the microheater itself). Joule-heating simulation is often not reliable because it depends on the specific material property, which depends on the fabrication parameters (e.g. sputtering, annealing). So, we need a method that combines both simulation and real temperature measurement data. <br/>
Here, a microheater is situated in the middle of a chip. while the temperature inside the region bounded by the microheater is our target. 2 points (Tm and Tm2) on the chip were selected below the microheater, where contact based temperature probe can be installed to get the exact temperature at those points. For a particular geometry and a pair of measured temperature (Tm and Tm2), by using FDM simulation it can be matched with the temperature inside the region, which is normally accessable. <br/>
Note: This code is valid for this pcarticular chip dimention and U shaped microheater. <br/>
1) simulate_mm.py does the 2D FDM simulation of a chip which contains a U shaped microheater, where microheater microheater width(W_mm) and microheater temperature(T_hot) is used as input. it outputs average temperature (Tc_avg) and standard deviation (Tc_std) inside the rectancgle bounded by the heater. Most importantly, it outputs Temperature at a point 1 mm (d_mm) below the bottom of the heater (Tm) and 2 mm right side it (Tm2). <br/>
2) GenerateDataset.py generates data with varying width of 0.2 to 3.6 mm and Input temperature varying from 200 to 400 degC. <br/>
3) PolynomialModel_RFModel.py uses the generated dataset to create a polynomial fit and gives the polynomial. It also train an Random Forrest model to compare them. <br/>
